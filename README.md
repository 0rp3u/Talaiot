## Talaiot[WIP]


"... while some certainly had a defensive purpose, the use of others is not clearly understood. Some believe them to have served the purpose of lookout or signalling towers..."

#### Intro

Talaiot is a simple plugin to track timing in your Android Builds.  

#### Why another plugin?

Maybe you are wondering why we need another tool to track time tasks, the idea comes becuase in Agoda originally we
 were using the great plugin https://github.com/passy/build-time-tracker-plugin, but we disabled on the use of Build-Scan
 from Gradle. 
 
 Build scans are excellent tools to understand problems on the build, detect bottlenecks and different behaviours. 
 
 In our case we didn't have the subscription of Gradle enterprise we wanted to understand what is the best approach the data
 and understand the problems of medium/big teams in teas
